Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use<br> <strong>Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for<mark> 'lorem ipsum' </mark>will uncover many web sites still in their infancy</strong>. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
